      <h3>This Is Test By Avraam Bukaya</h3>
      <p>
        I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love It's time that I realize
        There are some with no home Not a nickel to loan Could it be really me
        pretending that they're not alone A willow deeply scarred, somebody's
        broken heart And a washed-out dream They follow the pattern of the wind,
        ya see 'Cause they got no place to be That's why I'm starting with me
        I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?) I'm asking him to change
        his ways (Who?) And no message could have been any clearer If you wanna
        make the world a better place Take a look at yourself and then make a
        change
